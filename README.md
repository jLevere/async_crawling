# async_crawling

This is a project I am working on to learn python and python asyncio.  


The two parts are spiders and just general web scrapers.

Python asyncio is mainly used with I/O locked interactions, namely web requests.  The aiohttp package provides async support for http requests.  Using asyncio isnt always the best choice for projects, but some things like scraping are ideal use cases for it.  Asyncio based scrapers are startlingly fast when you are used to working with requests based programs.
